# What is this

Its a simple user interface to create tokens and to chat with LiveKit. It's not so secure, so only for testing :P.

You can view and copy tokens to develop.

# Howto

### Make sure your livekit is running see: https://docs.livekit.io/guides/getting-started

### Make sure you export your API and SECRET 
```
export LIVEKIT_API_KEY="yOuREApiKEY"
export LIVEKIT_API_SECRET="YourSecrET"
```

### install the tokenkit
```
npm i -g livekit-tokenkit
```

### run the tokenkit
```
tokenkit
```

### goto the webpage

You can also clone this git and run ```npm run serve``` in the client folder and edit the page yourself :D.
